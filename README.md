This is project which is more like Prizma app
You have to download "imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat" this is VGG model which is pre-trained model and copy this in model folder
you have to run this thing in anaonad and install tenserflow in that
You have to run nst_tf.py file 
This project is for apply one phot style in to another photo like prizma app and i put example also in this project
This project  store genrated image inside same folder 
Major aim for this project is reduce number of ittration that calculate by CNN for merge two photos
